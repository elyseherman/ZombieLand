# ZombieLand

## Description
ZombieLand is a Java-based interactive game that challenges players to find the optimal path using various algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Dijkstra's Algorithm. The game features multiple pathfinding criteria (shortest path, fastest path, safest path) and dynamic hazard avoidance, all wrapped in a user-friendly graphical user interface.

## Prerequisites
Before you can run the game, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Java 11 or higher
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: This IDE is recommended for handling project setup and execution smoothly.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pathfinder-game.git
```

### Step 2: Open the Project
Open IntelliJ IDEA and select File > Open. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the project and open it. IntelliJ IDEA should automatically detect the project settings and configure itself accordingly.

### Step 3: Configure JDK
1. Go to File > Project Structure > Project.
2. Set the Project SDK to Java 11 (or the version you have installed).
3. Click OK to save the settings.

## Running the Game

### From IntelliJ IDEA
1. In IntelliJ IDEA, locate the src folder in the project structure.
2. Right-click on the Main.java file and select Run 'Main.main()'.
3. The game interface should launch, and you can start playing by selecting your preferred algorithm and criteria for pathfinding.

## How to Play
- Choose an algorithm from BFS, DFS, or Dijkstra's to start the pathfinding process.
- Select the type of path you wish to find: shortest, fastest, or safest.
- Avoid hazards that dynamically appear on the grid as you navigate through the game.
- Reach the destination point in the least possible time while adhering to the selected path criteria.
